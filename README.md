Here is a short exemple of one of my research on how to use ARKIT, the all point is to use real location and transpose it on an AR object.
This could be use for finding someone in very crowded event for exemple. For now the application don't use the hight (will work on it later)
I used an online eventmanager/database pusher for simplify the backend, i'm thinking about using firebase later.
Here is an exemple simulating someone in a car and riding in ![](here.gif)
